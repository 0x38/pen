    <p>Stewart and his team put out several issues of <a href="The Whole Earth Catalog">The Whole Earth Catalog</a> , and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.</p>
    <blockquote>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</blockquote>
